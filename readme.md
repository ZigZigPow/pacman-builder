## Installation

Before running the game, you must have Python and Pygame installed on your system. Here's how to get started:

1. **Install Python**

   Ensure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install Pygame**

   Pygame is required to run the game. Install it using pip:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

3. **Download the Game**

Clone this repository or download the game files to your local machine.

4. **Running the Game**
After installation, navigate to the game directory in your terminal or command prompt and run the game with:

```bash
python pacman.py
```

## Customizing the Maze

To create your own unique maze for the Pac-Man game, follow these steps:

1. **Locate the Maze File**: Find the `maze.txt` file in the game's directory. This file contains the layout of the maze.

2. **Edit the Maze**: Open `maze.txt` with a text editor. The maze is represented by characters:
   - ` ` (space) for paths where the Pac-Man and the Ghost can move.
   - `@` Ôªøfor initial pacman location.
   - `U` Ôªøfor initial ghost locations.
   - Any other character for wall blocks.

3. **Design Your Maze**: Modify the arrangement of characters to shape your new maze. Be creative! Ensure there are no enclosed areas where Pac-Man or ghosts can get trapped.

4. **Save Your Changes**: After editing, save the `maze.txt` file.

5. **Test Your Maze**: Run the game to see your new maze in action. Make adjustments as needed to perfect your design.
