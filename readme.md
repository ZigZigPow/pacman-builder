## Customizing the Maze

To create your own unique maze for the Pac-Man game, follow these steps:

1. **Locate the Maze File**: Find the `maze.txt` file in the game's directory. This file contains the layout of the maze.

   - ` ` (space) for paths where the Pac-Man and the Ghost can move.
   - Any other character for wall blocks.
