## Customizing the Maze

To create your own unique maze for the Pac-Man game, follow these steps:

1. **Edit the Maze**: Open `pacman_game\_internal\mazes\maze.txt` with any text editor. The maze is represented by characters:
   - ` ` (space) for paths where the Pac-Man and the Ghost can move.
   - `@` for initial pacman location.
   - `U` for initial ghost locations.
   - Any other character for wall blocks.

3. **Design Your Maze**: Modify the arrangement of characters to shape your new maze. Be creative! Ensure there are no enclosed areas where Pac-Man or ghosts can get trapped.

4. **Save Your Changes**: After editing, save the `maze.txt` file.

5. **Test Your Maze**: Run the game to see your new maze in action. Make adjustments as needed to perfect your design.

Enjoy designing your own mazes for Pac-Man to navigate! ðŸŽ®ðŸ‘»
